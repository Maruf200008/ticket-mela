            {` Akshay Kumar plays a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent in this
            espionage thriller, inspired by true events. The story follows this
            star undercover agent who goes by the code name 'Bellbottom'. After
            a plane is hijacked and lands in Amritsar, the seventh hijacking
            incident in five years, he is brought in to save the day. Akshay's
            character plans a daring covert operation to rescue 210 hostages and
            neutralise four hijackers. Vaani Kapoor plays his wife while Huma
            Qureshi features as one of his team members. Lara Dutta looks almost
            unrecognisable as former prime minister Indira Gandhi.`}
